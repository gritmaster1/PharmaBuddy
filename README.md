# PharmAssistAI: Your Advanced Pharma Research Assistant

PharmAssistAI revolutionizes how pharmacy professionals and students approach learning and research related to FDA-approved drugs. By integrating modern information retrieval technologies with Large Language Models (LLMs), PharmAssistAI optimizes the research and learning workflow, making it less time-consuming and more efficient.

## Core Features

- **Comprehensive Data Access**: Directly tap into the FDA drug labels dataset, with plans to incorporate the FDA adverse reactions dataset for a fuller data spectrum.
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Utilize the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique for dynamic, real-time data retrieval.
- **Intelligent Summaries**: Leverage LLMs to generate insightful summaries and contextual answers.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with AI-generated related questions to deepen understanding and knowledge retention.
- **Research Linkage**: Automatically fetch and link relevant academic papers from PubMed, enhancing the depth of available information and supporting academic research.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

- **Real-Time Feedback with LangSmith**: Use LangSmith to incorporate real-time feedback and custom evaluations. This system ensures that the AI's responses are not only accurate but also contextually aware and user-focused.
- **Custom Evaluators for Enhanced Accuracy**: Deploy custom evaluators like PharmAssistEvaluator to ensure responses meet high standards of relevance, safety, and perception as human-generated versus AI-generated.

## How It Works

1. **Query Input**: Pharmacists type in their questions directly.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Relevant data is fetched from comprehensive datasets, including automated searches of PubMed for related academic papers.
3. **Data Presentation**: Data is displayed in an easily digestible format.
4. **Summary Generation**: Summaries of the data are created using GenAI
5. **Question Suggestion**: Suggest related questions to encourage further exploration.
